# Delving into High-Quality Synthetic Face Occlusion Segmentation Datasets

This paper performs comprehensive analysis on datasets
for occlusion-aware face segmentation, a task that is cru-
cial for many downstream applications. The collection and
annotation of such datasets are time-consuming and labor-
intensive. Although some efforts have been made in syn-
thetic data generation, the naturalistic aspect of data re-
mains less explored. In our study, we propose two occlu-
sion generation techniques, Naturalistic Occlusion Genera-
tion (NatOcc), for producing high-quality naturalistic syn-
thetic occluded faces; and Random Occlusion Generation
(RandOcc), a more general synthetic occluded data gener-
ation method (Figure 1). We empirically show the effec-
tiveness and robustness of both methods, even for unseen
occlusions. To facilitate model evaluation, we present two
high-resolution real-world occluded face datasets with fine-
grained annotations, RealOcc and RealOcc-Wild, featuring
both careful alignment preprocessing and an in-the-wild
setting for robustness test. We further conduct a compre-
hensive analysis on a newly introduced segmentation bench-
mark, offering insights for future exploration.
